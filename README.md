---------SEAN JENSEN FINAL VUE PROJECT--------

I use Javascript logic to render the list of pokemon on three different pages.

I use props to generate the main list of pokemon.

I use a form with validation on the My Team page. I included some rules 
for user input.

I used two vue animations in conjunction to enhance the main pokemon list.

I use three different routes and a vue router for navigation between them. 

I connect to a Firebase server using vue-resource to get a random list of
team names on the My Team page.

I use Vuex to manage the user's selected pokemon, allowing the user to add 
pokemon on the pokedex page, then access and modify that list of pokemon
on the My Team page and the Type Analysis page.
